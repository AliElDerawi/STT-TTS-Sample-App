This sample project use RecognizerIntent to make Speec To Text (STT) for two languages (En,Ar), you could read more about RecognizerIntent from here:

https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognizerIntent.html

Then The result could be coverted to Speech using TextToSpeech native android support library, you could read more about TextToSpeech from here:

https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech.html

If you need more powerfull solution for SpeechToText, you might use Google Cloud Speech API:

### From my expericne with RecognizerIntent, it give a very accurate result in Online Mode.

In offline it have many cons:


1- The result is not accurate.

2- Can't recognize all languases.
